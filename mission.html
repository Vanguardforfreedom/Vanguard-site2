      Vanguard was born out of a burden — too many Christian conservatives today have lost the Christian part when engaging in politics. That’s why we founded Vanguard: to speak boldly, but biblically. We believe the Bible is the foundation of truth, logic is the structure of argument, and Christ is the cornerstone.

      We stand for the Constitution, for American heritage, and the God-given freedoms our Founding Fathers enshrined. But yelling at people doesn’t win hearts. Truth does. That’s why we don’t scream — we speak. We don’t cancel — we converse. And we always start with Christ.
